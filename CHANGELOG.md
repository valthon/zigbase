# Changelog

All notable changes to ZigBase are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

First public release: a single-binary, PocketBase-inspired (not API-compatible)
backend-as-a-service in Zig 0.16, plus an embeddable Zig framework.

### Added
- **Collections & schema engine** with migrations and a `migrate` CLI command.
- **Records CRUD** with a typed query API: `filter` (comparison + `&&`/`||` + relation-path traversal + `@request.*` macros), `sort`, `expand`, and pagination.
- **Per-collection API access rules** (list/view/create/update/delete): superuser-only, public, or filter-expression.
- **Authentication** — argon2id password hashing, JWT sessions over an httpOnly cookie with double-submit CSRF (and bearer tokens), and a `superuser create` CLI command.
- **OAuth2** — client-driven PKCE with Google / GitHub / Microsoft / Discord presets; AES-GCM-encrypted client secrets at rest.
- **Realtime** over WebSocket — rule-filtered create/update/delete events, per-subscription filters.
- **File storage** — local-disk backend behind an S3-ready storage interface; protected files via short-lived tokens.
- **Embedded admin UI** at `/_/` — a no-build Preact SPA (collections, records, schema editor, realtime live-view, OAuth2 config).
- **Embeddable Zig framework** — extend ZigBase from your own Zig app via comptime configuration: record lifecycle hooks, custom HTTP routes (with `public`/`authed`/`superuser` gating), auth/file/lifecycle/error events, a cron/interval/reactive job scheduler with a worker pool, and `app.submit` for ad-hoc background work. Misconfiguration (unknown config keys, typo'd hook phases) is a compile error.
- **Apache-2.0 license** and cross-platform release binaries (Linux + macOS).

### Known limitations
See [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) — notably: no mailer (auth tokens are logged, not emailed), no auth rate-limiting, and a single-process scheduler.
